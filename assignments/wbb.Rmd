scale function gives us a between 1 and 0 value to help calculate our average. We have to make sure that the z-score is a number. We multiply the opponent's stats by -1 to denote that they are "worse" compared to our values. 

Z-scores are to help compare specific metrics.

```{r}

teamzscore <- teamtotals |> 
  mutate(
    FGzscore = as.numeric(scale(FGAvg, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)), 
    RebZscore = as.numeric(scale(ReboundAvg, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    OppZscore = as.numeric(scale(OppFGAvg, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)) * -1,
    OppRebZScore = as.numeric(scale(OffRebAvg, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)) * -1,
    TotalZscore = FGzscore + RebZscore + OppZscore + OppRebZScore
  )  

```

teamzscore |> arrange(desc(TotalZscore))

```{r}
